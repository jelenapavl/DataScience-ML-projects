This repository contains some of my projects related to supervised machine learning, and I will be adding more as I complete them.

All projects are developed in Jupyter Notebook and include detailed descriptions to clarify:

- The key steps taken,
- The main objectives, and
- The most important insights gained.
- 
Feel free to explore the notebooks and provide feedback.
